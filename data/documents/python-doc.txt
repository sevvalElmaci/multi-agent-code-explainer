Python Programming Language

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Main Characteristics:
- Easy to learn and read with clean syntax
- Dynamic typing and automatic memory management
- Extensive standard library with built-in modules
- Large ecosystem of third-party packages via PyPI
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming support

Popular Use Cases:
Web development is a major application area for Python. Frameworks like Django and FastAPI make it easy to build web applications and APIs. Python is also widely used in data science and machine learning. Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn provide powerful tools for data analysis.

Automation and scripting are other common use cases. Python can automate repetitive tasks and system administration. Scientific computing and research also rely heavily on Python. The language is used in fields like physics, biology, and astronomy.

Python Philosophy:
The Zen of Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity. Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Readability counts. These principles guide Python development and make the language accessible to beginners while remaining powerful for experts.
