Git Version Control System

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git has become the most widely used version control system in the world.

Core Concepts:

Repository is a directory that contains your project files and the complete history of all changes. Repositories can be local on your machine or remote on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

Commits are snapshots of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and contains information about what changed, who made the change, and when. Commits form a timeline of your project history.

Branches allow you to diverge from the main line of development and work on features independently. The main branch (usually called main or master) contains the production-ready code. Feature branches let developers work on new features without affecting the main codebase.

Basic Workflow:

Clone creates a local copy of a remote repository. This downloads all files and complete history to your machine. You can then work on the code locally.

Add stages changes for commit. Staging allows you to prepare exactly which changes you want to include in the next commit. You can stage individual files or specific parts of files.

Commit saves staged changes to the local repository. Each commit should have a clear, descriptive message explaining what changed and why. Good commit messages help teammates understand project history.

Push uploads local commits to a remote repository. This shares your changes with other team members. Push updates the remote branch with your local commits.

Pull downloads changes from a remote repository to your local repository. This keeps your local code synchronized with the remote. Pull combines fetch and merge operations.

Collaboration Features:

Merge combines changes from different branches. When a feature is complete, its branch can be merged back into the main branch. Git automatically combines non-conflicting changes.

Pull Requests facilitate code review before merging. Team members can review changes, leave comments, and suggest improvements. Pull requests are a key part of collaborative development workflows.

Conflict Resolution handles situations where the same code is modified in different ways. Git marks conflicts and allows developers to manually resolve them. This ensures all changes are properly integrated.

Best Practices:
Commit often with clear messages. Create branches for new features. Keep commits small and focused. Review code before merging. Use meaningful branch names. Write descriptive commit messages.
