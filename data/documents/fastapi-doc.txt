What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

Key Features:
- Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go
- Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%
- Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human errors
- Intuitive: Great editor support with auto-completion everywhere
- Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn
- Short: Minimize code duplication with multiple features from each parameter declaration
- Robust: Get production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation
- Standards-based: Based on OpenAPI and JSON Schema

Performance:
FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks available.
It's based on Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.
The framework provides automatic request validation and serialization.

Example Usage:
Creating an API endpoint with FastAPI is straightforward.
You define a Python function and add a decorator.
The framework automatically generates interactive API documentation.
Type hints are used for automatic data validation and conversion.
